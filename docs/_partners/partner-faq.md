## Tip 1: Level up your team

Make sure your sales and support teams say "yes!" when asked about an integration. Share these bite-sized [Zapier 101 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqzJRGwum4KO2ISMYKmK0Ci7hm_508NfO) to get them up-to-speed on Zapier.

## Tip 2: Track your Zapier users' retention and activity

We routinely hear from our partners that Zapier users are higher-value, sticky users. Check to confirm tracking is in place so you can benchmark your Zapier users and easily report ROI to your team.

**Steal this from Clearbit:** Clearbit carefully tracks the success of their users and discovered Zapier users are 20% less likely to churn. Armed with this data, their team prioritizes promotion and development strategies that encourage more of their users to try integrations.

## Tip 3: Share Zapier use cases in your onboarding

From tool tips to testimonials, make sure your newest customers know it's possible to connect your tool to {{ site.partner_count }} other web apps via Zapier.

**Steal this from Base:** Base CRM shares a customer story in their onboarding sequence to help new users picture automation magic in their own work. The result? Stickier users right from the get-go.

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Identifying a point in your onboarding sequence that makes sense to introduce Zapier to new users.
> + Linking to a customer story, a detailed help doc, or even display your most popular Zaps with [a simple snippet of code](https://zapier.com/partner/embed/).

## Tip 4: Suggest Zapier as an answer to common support questions

What are your customers searching for help on? Our top partners think beyond a one-size-fits-all Zapier help doc. Whether it's how to export data to Google Sheets, or how to get custom alerts for new data, crafting custom Zapier tutorials helps you have answers at the ready.

**Steal this from Trello:** Trello's team gets a lot of questions about how to import project data. [This help doc](https://help.trello.com/article/751-importing-data-into-trello) shows how easy it is to automatically import to Trello, along with pre-made Zaps for popular workflows.

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Asking your support and sales teams about the questions they often receive. Can Zapier solve these problems?
> + [Creating a pre-made Zap](https://zapier.com/developer/shared-zaps/create/) for a step-by-step solution to that common problem.
> + Writing a tutorial with the pre-made Zap [embedded](https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/zap-templates/#generate-static-lists-of-zaps) in your doc so readers can build the workflow without leaving your site.

## Tip 5: Power up your app marketplace with Zapier-enabled listings

Chances are, your users are searching your marketplace for the apps they want to connect to. Close the loop on those high-intent searches with listings for the apps your users search for most, powered by Zapier.

**Steal this from AWeber:** AWeber shows off a huge library of integrations, with popular apps enabled by Zapier. That way, prospects aren't turned away when searching for the apps they want to connect to their email lists.

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Adding the logos for the apps your users want most to your marketplace.
> + Or leveraging [Zapier's Partner API](https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/partner-api/#app-directory) to programmatically deploy and maintain your marketplace.

## Tip 6: Point empty marketplace search results to Zapier

Make sure your users aren't left empty-handed. When search results in your marketplace turn up empty, point them to Zapier (chances are, we support their favorite app).

**Steal this from Help Scout:** Help Scout prompts users to search for the integrations they want. When a search result comes up empty, a short snippet of default text suggests Zapier.

![](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/c6e2f18f1054a28e75a975cd9c3f99f8.png)

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Adding a search bar to your integrations directory
> + Displaying this sentence as default text on an empty search state, "Can't find what you're looking for? See if you can integrate with it via Zapier."

## Tip 7: Surface Zapier in your website footer

Help your users find what they're looking for by linking to your Zapier integration from your site footer.

**Steal this from Close.io:** Close.io helps users discover their Zapier integration by linking to Zapier topics from their footer. This helps new users find out about Zapier and keeps Close.io as a top Zapier integration.

## Tip 8: Seamlessly surface Zapier integrations within your app

Rather than sending your users over to Zapier, keep them engaged inside your product. Help users discover and set up pre-made Zaps at the point where they want to connect data to another tool, so there's no need to leave your app.

**Steal this from Facebook:** Facebook makes it easy for their Lead Ads users to add lead data to their email lists and CRMs. Every time an ad publisher creates a new ad, they are prompted to search for the app they want to send lead data to, and can build the Zap from right inside of Facebook.

![](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/0ad5c62d1bfc152ec685d9f5c1dcc3c7.png)

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Using our [widget](https://zapier.com/partner/embed/) to embed popular Zaps in just a few minutes.
> + Or designing a custom experience via our [Partner API](https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/partner-api/)

## Tip 9: Leverage marketing automation

Zero in on the users most likely to adopt automation into their everyday work. Watch for users to hit key milestones in your app, like creating a new contact or exporting data. Then, suggest automation as a natural next step.

**Steal this from Autopilot:** Autopilot celebrates when users activate a chat feature, then suggests Zapier as a solution for automated contact management.

![](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/5a6b1f983bc431286a2e1501b50a8257.png)

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Identifying key actions your users that can be boosted with automation.
> + Using your marketing automation to message users who take that action.

## Tip 10: Add new features to your Zapier integration

As your product evolves, your integration should, too. An up-to-date, bug-free integration makes automation magic a breeze for users.

**Steal this from Thinkific:** As Thinkific's feature set grows, they improve their Zapier integration, too. By promoting these updates in blog posts and product newsletters, existing users learn how to power up their workflows and new users discover Zapier automation.

> **Do this yourself by:**

> + Making an update your users are asking for. Review feature requests by logging in to [the dashboard](https://zapier.com/developer/builder) with your developer credentials.
> + Creating new [Zap Templates](https://zapier.com/developer/shared-zaps/create/) to inspire use cases.
> + Promoting the new Zapier features to your users in a blog post or email.

## What is the Zapier Partner Program?

The [Zapier Partner Program](https://zapier.com/platform/partner-program) is a program for Zapier's [{{ site.partner_count }} integration partners](https://zapier.com/apps). It is designed to give all partners a clear path to success for their integrations and reward them with benefits along the way.

## I'm already a Zapier partner. How do I know what level I'm in?

Find out where you stand by [signing up](https://zapier.typeform.com/to/ItvJSG) for our monthly partner newsletter or [logging in](https://zapier.com/developer/builder/) with your developer credentials.

## How do I become a part of the Zapier Partner Program?

You're eligible for the Zapier Partner Program once you build and [launch your Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/lifecycle-activation/#process).

## How are the program's levels calculated? How often can I change levels in the program? Can I move down levels?

Your level in the Zapier Partner Program is determined by your integration's number of active users and integration health score.

![](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/f050f5e3c39829a08a016c42ef5c491b.png)

Levels are evaluated on a fixed quarterly basis: at the beginning of January, April, July, and October.

You can change levels every quarter. You cannot change levels in the middle of a quarter. If at the beginning of a quarter, you don't meet all requirements of a level, you will move down to a level that you do meet all the requirements of.

## How is my integration's number of active users calculated? How can I increase it?

This metric looks at how many people are actively using your Zapier integration this quarter. Since this number accumulates over the quarter, it is normal to see a drop at the beginning of each quarter compared to the end of last quarter.

To increase usage of your Zapier integration, try out [these 10 tactics](https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/partner-program-tips/).

## How is my integration's health score calculated? How can I improve it?

We calculate the integration health score by looking at how many feature requests and bugs have been reported for your integration and how responsive your team is to those reports. Some feature requests and bugs impact your score more than others. For example, a feature request with 100 users voting for it will impact your health score more than a feature request with 1 vote.

As a reminder, our goal for all integrations is for them to maintain a "healthy" health score. No level of the program requires an "exceptional" health score (although it's certainly great if your integration does go above and beyond!).

![](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/photos/1e71ec2a31c0cdecf7880f4ac1f4915d.gif)

To improve your health score, [respond to](https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/feature-requests-bugs/) and resolve your outstanding feature requests and bugs by logging into the [developer platform](https://zapier.com/developer/builder/) and navigating to the "Issues" tab.

## How can I access my integration and see my Partner Program metrics outside of your monthly emails?

Use your developer's credentials to log into the [developer platform](https://zapier.com/developer/builder/). If you can't access it, please [email us](mailto:partners@zapier.com) and we can help!

## Is my level in the Partner Program visible to others?

Zapier won't externally share your level in the Partner Program with anyone, including other partners and Zapier users. But if you'd like to, you're welcome to share your level in the program with your users.

**If your questions weren't answered above, feel free to [email us](mailto:partners@zapier.com).**
