# Zapier Issue Manager

## What is Zapier Issue Manager?
As users encounter bugs or think of new features they’d like within your integration, some reach out to the Zapier support team. Those requests are logged in Zapier’s issue tracker, which you can see from the [Bug & Feature Requests page](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/feature-requests-bugs#how-to-monitor-feature-requests-and-bugs) of the integration’s developer platform.

If you prefer syncing and managing these requests from your own issue-tracking tools (such as Jira or Trello), you can create Zaps to do so using Zapier Issue Manager.

Zapier Issue Manager makes it easy to engage with requests escalated by Zapier’s support team in a timely manner. This can help improve your integration’s [health score](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/partner-faq#how-is-my-integrations-health-score-calculated-how-can-i-improve-it) and increase your tier in the [Partner Program](https://zapier.com/platform/partner-program). The more you maintain a bug-free, quality integration, the more essential your product becomes to your users' workflows. This sets you up to reduce churn, drive account upgrades, and increase customer lifetime value.
