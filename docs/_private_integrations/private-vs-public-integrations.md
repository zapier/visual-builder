# Private vs public integrations

When building an integration on the Zapier Platform, you must [specify the intended audience](https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/create-integration). The intended audience determines whether the integration will be private or public:

* Public integration: For public use and accessible to all Zapier customers.
* Private integration: For personal, internal (e.g. with your team), personal, or controlled-access use.

Both private and public integrations can connect to Zapier’s app directory of over [5000+ integrations](https://zapier.com/apps). Depending on your intended audience, there will be different features and limitations available to you. 

> **Note**: The intended audience is different from your integration’s status. All integrations, regardless of intent, start with a private status. Learn more in [Zapier integration review guidelines](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/integration-review-guidelines).



## Public integrations

Public integrations are suitable for the following use cases:

* Connect your product to Zapier for public use
* Gain exposure from Zapier’s 3 million+ users



 By creating a public integration, you’ll have access to these features:

* Join the [Zapier Partner Program](https://zapier.com/platform/partner-program).
* Publish your integration in [Zapier’s app directory](https://zapier.com/apps).
* [Create Zap templates](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/zap-templates).
* [Embed Zapier in your product](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/overview).
* [Embed Zap Templates](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/zap-templates).
* Use [Zapier Issue Manager](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/zim) to manage bugs and feature requests.
* Users of your integration can [Share a copy of their Zaps](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496292155405-Share-a-copy-of-your-Zap).

### Limitations

If you’re building a public integration, there are specific limitations to be aware of: 

* To create a public integration, you need to meet the [Integration Ownership criteria](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/integration-review-guidelines#21-integration-ownership).
* Public integrations can only have up to [100 admins and collaborators](https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/invite-team-member). 
* You can’t restrict who uses your public integration.



## Private integrations

Private integrations are suitable for the following use cases: 

* Connect your internal tool or system to Zapier.
* Extend what you can do with [Webhooks](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496326446989-Send-webhooks-in-Zaps) or [Code](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496310939021-Use-JavaScript-code-in-Zaps) steps.
* Connect your product to Zapier to build workflows for your team.
* Create an integration for a staging or testing environment.

By creating a private integration:

* You control who has access to your integration.
* Your private integration won’t appear within [Zapier’s app directory](https://zapier.com/apps).

### Limitations

If you’re building a private integration, there are specific limitations to be aware of:

* It’s not currently possible to [create Zap templates](https://platform.zapier.com/partners/zap-templates).
* [Rate limits](https://platform.zapier.com/private_integrations/private-integration-rate-limits) for users will vary based on the Zapier plan of the integration owner.
