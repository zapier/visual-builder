# New Analytics Section, In-App Validation Help, Making Publishing Easier

_Zapier Developer Platform Team \| March 4, 2020_

The team's been working to make it easier to publish, maintain and extend a great Zapier integration for your product.  Here's some highlights of features and changes in February.

## New Analytics Section

You'll now be able to see how many Zaps are using your Triggers, Actions, & Searches.  We'll show how many are paused and how many are active. And you'll be able to see this data for each of your versions.

This data is available whether you are developing in the CLI or in the visual builder.  It's also available to you no matter whether your Zapier integration is published or still private.  

This is an extremely useful tool to understand what features your users are finding valuable, and which ones you might need to explore to understand why they aren't taking off.  It's super useful understanding what's going on in migration scenarios as well.

Note that this data set shows how many _Zaps_ are using each trigger and action, but doesn't indicate how many of these Zaps have successfully _run_ and generated task history, which is our key performance gauge.

We're committed to bringing you better insights and data to help you create great experiences for your users, so this is just the first of several analytics coming to the platform in 2020.

## Better Access to Help Content in Validation Messages

We're working to make it easier to understand and fix feedback that the validation tool provides developers.  This month we shipped an incremental improvement allowing you to drill down to get information about what needs fixing, without leaving the tool.  We'll be building on this to add links to where you need to go to actually make the change.


## Making Publishing Steps Clearer

We split out "Publishing" from "Sharing".  We used to combine these into a section called "Visibility".  This is a small change, but one of several coming designed to make the process of getting a Zapier integration published more clear for the new developer.

And speaking of making publishing easier, we've changed our publishing requirement to having 3 testers for your triggers and actions, from 10.  We found this was time consuming to wrangle that many testers for lots of developers.  We still find it's important to get _some_ eyes on your integration before sharing with the world though, so recruit 3 users to put it through its paces on your way to submitting to be published in the App Directory!

## Migrating Legacy Web Builder Integrations

We are continuing to convert Web Builder integrations to our new platform, and will migrate all Zaps to the new version of your integration.  Watch for an email from the team about this.  If you have a legacy Web Builder integration we'll let you know when your date for conversion is coming up.  No action will be required on your part.  We're trying to make this as easy as possible for everyone.

## Tip of the Month:

> Did you know that if you're developing in the visual builder tool you can easily switch over to the Zapier CLI?  If you find yourself managing a lot of Javascript code in the UI, collaborating with other developers, wanting to build automated regression tests, or use advanced features of the Zapier Platform it's time to give it a look!  When you open your project in the CLI you'll simply be creating a new _version_ in your existing project.  More details [here](https://platform.zapier.com/docs/export)

## What's Coming Next?

- Adding more assistance to validation messages to help you quickly address the feedback provided.
- Developers with Beta integrations will be getting more dashboard data to understand the performance and status of their integration.
