# Update Your Web Builder Integration To Run On The Current Platform

## Overview

In 2017 Zapier released a major update to our platform, which includes access to better analytics, versioning, migration, deprecation facilities, and more. Integrations created with the original Web Builder tool need to be adapted to run on the new platform. Then your users’ Zaps must be updated with the new version of your integration.

We created a self-service conversion tool to recreate Legacy Web Builder integrations on the new platform, and update your users’ Zaps. You won’t need to write any code or require action from your users.

The tool will guide you through a three step process:

1. Create a copy of your integration updated for the new platform.
1. Test your integration’s triggers and actions on the new platform.
1. Update your existing users’ Zaps to use the new integration.

The legacy platform will be disabled this year, so this process is required to maintain your integration. We’ve worked hard to make this process as easy as possible while avoiding any impact on users.

> **This feature is being progressively rolled out, and may not be immediately available for your integration. It is planned to be available to most developers by the end of April 2021.**
