# Embed Full Zapier Experience into your product or website

The Full Zapier Experience is a prebuilt UI component that offers the quickest—and easiest—way to surface your Zapier integration directly within your own product. 

With the Full Zapier Experience, you can create a seamless experience for your users that allows them to automate workflows without having to switch tasks or apps halfway through a job.

## Example implementation

This video shows an example implementation of the Full Zapier Experience, and how users can discover workflow use cases, create and edit Zaps, and manage their existing Zaps all within your platform:

## Customize

The [generator](https://zapier.com/partner/solutions/plug-and-play) lets you customize the visual design and features of Zapier you want to include, and generate code snippets that can be copied and pasted directly into your site. Generate the embed code in HTML, Vanilla JS, React, Angular, or Vue.js 2. No engineering resources are required.

Find the Full Zapier Experience under Embed on the left-hand menu of your integration in the [Platform UI](https://developer.zapier.com/) once your app is Published.

## User features

### Discover

Take advantage of Zapier’s extensive and industry-leading app directory by embedding a customized version of Zapier’s App Directory. Users can search through thousands of available apps to pair with yours and see popular workflows at a glance. Our generator allows you to customize the number of apps that are displayed and allows you to exclude apps by name or by app category.

### Create

When clicking on a template or app listing, a modal opens up within your site, prompting users to log in or sign up if they don't have a Zapier account. Enable [Quick Account Creation](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/quick-account-creation) to make this even simpler for users. 
Once done, the Zap Editor will open on this same modal, and users can create Zaps.

### Manage

Once users have created Zaps, they’re able to see them directly inside your product. They can view their Zaps and see their status at a glance without having to go through Zapier first.
