# Private integration rate limits

Private integration rate limits are based on your current Zapier plan. When users use your private app in their Zaps, their Zap runs will be [held](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496291148685-View-and-manage-your-Zap-history) if they exceed the following limits:

- Free, Starter, and Professional plans: 100 calls every 60 seconds.
- Team, or Company plans: 5000 calls every 60 seconds.

This rate limit is cumulative across all users of your private integration.
