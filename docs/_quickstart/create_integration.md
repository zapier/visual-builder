## Create a New Integration

In a few steps, we’ll create a simple example Zapier integration that works with GitHub issues. You can explore the project, add authentication and API connections, run tests, deploy it to the Zapier platform, and use it in Zaps.

_Add your app's name, logo, description, and category before building a Zapier integration_

Start by making a new integration. Open [Zapier visual builder](https://zapier.com/app/developer/){:target="_blank"} and click _[Start a Integration](https://zapier.com/app/developer/app/new){:target="_blank"}_. Add a name for this sample integration like `My GitHub Example`, then add a description and and logo, perhaps's GitHub’s for this example integration. Below that, answer a few questions about the integration, then click create.

Well done! Now, let's make this new integration do some stuff.
