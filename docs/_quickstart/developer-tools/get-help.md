# Get help with the Zapier Platform

Get help building your app integration through the following channels:

## Developer Support on the Zapier Platform

The Platform Support team is equipped to assist you with a variety of topics to ensure your development process is as smooth as possible. Here's how we can help:

- **Integration Maintenance & Launch**: Guidance on updating your integrations and launching new versions through both our UI and CLI.
- **Authentication, Trigger & Action Setup**: Assistance with configuring authentication to your API and configuring the triggers and actions that make your integrations run.
- **Error Handling**: Advice on best practices for error messaging and handling, aiming for clarity and helpfulness to end-users.
- **Log Troubleshooting**: Support in interpreting and troubleshooting logs to resolve issues swiftly.

The following areas are however beyond our support scope:

- **Custom JavaScript Code**: We cannot provide support for writing or structuring your custom JavaScript code.
- **API Behavior Debugging**: We're unable to offer assistance with debugging unpredictable behaviors from third-party APIs.
- **Application-Specific Advice**: While we'd love to help with everything, we can't provide tailored suggestions for the specifics of your individual application.

We encourage developers to use our comprehensive documentation and community resources for topics that fall outside of our support boundaries. Our aim is to empower you with the tools and knowledge you need to excel on the Zapier Platform.
