- **Zap**: An automated Zapier workflow including a trigger and at least one one action.
- **Trigger**: The app integration step that starts a Zapier workflow when new or updated data is added to that app, either by Zapier polling the API to check for new data or with notification REST webhooks that push new data to Zapier.
- **Action**: An app integration step that finds, creates, or updates data in the app through a Zapier workflow using an HTTP PUT or POST request to the API.
- **Search action**: An app integration step that finds data in an app through a Zapier workflow, optionally with a create action to add an item if nothing is found.
- **Filter**: A built-in Zapier action step with conditional values to watch for specific data and only continue the workflow if certain conditions are met.
- **Paths**: Zapier’s conditional workflow tool that combines Filters and Actions to create multiple outcomes for workflows.
- **Formatter**: A built-in Zapier action to customize text, numbers, dates, and other data.
- **Delay**: A built-in Zapier action to wait a specified amount of time before running the remainder of the workflow.
- **Input Fields**: Individual data received from trigger and action steps in Zapier, used to map data to action steps.
