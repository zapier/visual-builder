# Company branding guidelines

Your customers already recognize your app name and logo, and they’ll look for it inside Zapier. Zapier users who have never used your app may discover it through Zapier when looking for a new tool. That makes consistent branding a requirement for a Zapier integration.

The search for new apps and integrations starts at the [Zapier app directory](https://zapier.com/apps/). Apps are ranked by popularity and category, with a search box to filter through the list.

_App Directory listings help users discover new ways to connect apps_

Each app includes a standalone app profile page. Your app’s branding plays the strongest role here as it's the first place many users will see your app on Zapier. Here users explore details about your app and its integrations, or select another popular app to see how the two can work together in Zapier.

App profile pages include [Zap Templates](https://platform.zapier.com/publish/zap-templates), predefined and curated examples of popular integration use cases with pre-mapped fields that users can set up in a few clicks.

Inside Zapier’s account dashboard, the _Start with a template_ section shows Zap Templates for apps users have connected to their accounts.

Inside the core Zapier app, users will again see your app name and logo in the Zap editor, where they can select the apps they want to connect in a Zap.

When creating a new Zapier integration, you’ll be asked to add the app’s name, logo, description and category when building; along with a brand color when the integration is submitted for publishing. 

Follow these guidelines to effectively brand your app on Zapier:

## App name

Use the actual, unique name of your app with the same capitalization your company uses in your core branding. Trademark/copyright identifiers such as a TM suffix aren't allowed in the app name, though they can be added to the description.

Do not add adjectives or phrases to your app name, and only include your company name if the company and app name are always used together in your branding. Do not include the word "app" unless you always include that in your app’s branding. 

**Example**:

- `Evernote`, not `Evernote Note Taking App` or `EverNote`
- `Google Sheets`, not `Sheets` or `Google Spreadsheets`
- `App Name`, not `App Name's integration`

## App logo

The logo must be a square, transparent PNG at least 256x256px in size. Please use a bigger version if you have one available. If your app has a solid, square background, round the corners 3% of the width and set the background as transparent. If your icon is not square, make a square transparent image and center your icon inside the transparent square. Do not include the app name or other copy in the logo as it will not be legible at small sizes.

**Example**:

![Evernote icon on Zapier](https://cdn.zappy.app/e1ac0809ac62bfd74330479dc22c9038.png)

Evernote's elephant icon is included in a transparent square rectangle.

![Todoist icon on Zapier](https://cdn.zappy.app/47de5413e9b17530628040488ddd868c.png)

Todoist's icon includes transparent, rounded corners.


## App description copy

Write a short description (up to 140 characters) of your app’s core features and use cases in the form of *<Integration Name> is a....* . 
The description should be less about selling the platform and more about what the platform actually does. Use proper English and full sentences. The copy should not include links or mentions of Zapier. Do not use flowery or overstated language, or make it appear your integration is associated with or endorsed by Zapier.

**Example**:

- `Trello is a team collaboration tool to organize anything on a kanban board.`, not `Trello is the best project management tool.`
- `Dropbox lets you store files online, sync them to all your devices, and share them easily.`, not `A file storage app.`

## Category

Select the category that best fits your app's core features and use case. If your app includes features from multiple categories, choose the category that best describes your app’s primary use case today.

You may update your app's category in the future if needed, so do not select a category that fits your future ambitions for the app instead of its features today. Additionally, do not select a category that applies only to a secondary feature in your app or a narrow category that does not cover your app’s broader focus.

### Available Categories

We offer a variety of categories for you to list your integration in. Each top-level category includes all integrations from its child categories. To maximize visibility for your integration, we recommend selecting a specific child category rather than a general parent category. Integrations within each category are ranked by popularity. By choosing a child category, your integration can achieve a higher ranking and greater visibility within that category.

**Example**:

- _Slack_ is primarily a team communication tool for chat, so it fits best in the `team chat` category alongside apps like _Discord_ and _ChatWork_, not in the `video calls` category even though it does include a video call tool as a secondary feature.
- _Google Contacts_ is primarily an address book that fits best with other `contacts` apps, while _HubSpot CRM_ can manage contacts but also includes deals and contact tracking which makes it a better fit for the `CRM` category.

## Colors

When you release your Zapier integration to the public, Zapier requires your app’s primary color. The primary color is the main color used in your app’s logo or branding.

![Gmail primary colors in App Directory](https://cdn.zappy.app/bef595e339362f712a227679316d1357.png)

Do not use pure white (`#FFFFFF`) as the color, as overlaid text would be unreadable. If your logo is black and white, use the next most common color from your branding.

Zapier uses the primary color as the background color in your app’s Zapier App Directory listing, and may additionally use it in the Zapier app dashboard, Zapier blog marketing materials, and other parts of Zapier’s app and content that promote your app’s integrations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can my integration belong to more than 1 category?**

Currently, we only allow 1 category per integration^. This is to maintain our categorization effectiveness, making it easier for users to find relevant integrations. Limiting integrations to 1 category also helps to improve your discoverability within the category.

_^Additional categories are limited to App Families and AI Tools at Zapier's discretion_


**Can I change my integration’s category in the future?**

Yes, you can. Submit the Rebrand Form located at the top of the Settings page for your integration in the [Developer platform](https://developer.zapier.com).

![Screenshot showing how to access the rebranding form](https://cdn.zappy.app/45d5c80072008f65856e8304a6394866.png)


**What’s an App Family?**

An app family refers to a collection of related integrations, typically developed by the same organization. Being added to an App Family is at the discretion of Zapier.


**How can I become a Premium integration?**

Being classified as a Premium app isn’t something we currently offer to partner-owned integrations. The justification as to why a Zapier-owned integration might be classed as Premium varies, but is often due to an increased cost on our end to be able to offer that integration. Only users on a paid Zapier plan can use Premium integrations, which helps to ensure we can continue to invest in the development of that integration.


**Can I suggest a new category?**

[Submit this form](https://integration-branding.zapier.app/suggest) to suggest a new category. Our team will review all submissions for consideration. If we move forward with adding your suggestion as a category, we'll notify you via email.
