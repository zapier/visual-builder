# Best practices for showcasing your integration

Sharing well-crafted content about your Zapier integration can help you improve user adoption, highlight key use cases, and simplify integration processes. Need some inspiration? The following examples show how some of our partners are effectively communicating their Zapier integrations across different platforms.

## Integration pages

A popular option for showcasing your integration is to create a dedicated, visually engaging landing page for Zapier on your website’s integrations directory. 

To drive faster adoption, follow these best practices for your page:

- **Link to customer stories** — Share customer success stories that reference how Zapier has saved your users time and effort.
- **Add quotes** — Feature quotes that showcase how Zapier has driven meaningful improvements in users’ workflow efficiencies.
- **Embed Zap templates** — Show the most relevant use cases for your customers, and embed related Zap templates directly onto the page with our [embed tools](https://zapier.com/developer-platform/embed-tools). That way, users can easily build Zaps—without ever having to leave the integration page.

_Examples_: [BrightHR](https://www.brighthr.com/ca/integrations/zapier/), [SwagUp](https://www.swagup.com/integrations/zapier), [TrueReview](https://www.truereview.co/app/zaps), [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/marketplace/app/zapier/10f6b602cda330ef)

## Help documentation

Write help documentation with clear, step-by-step instructions for integrating Zapier with your app. 

These best practices can help your docs stand out: 

- **Embed Zap templates** — Just like with your integration pages, embedding Zap templates directly in help docs can help reduce the friction of setup.
- **Be detailed** — Guide users who might be completely new to automation with detailed instructions.
- **Use visuals** — Keeping the docs visually engaging can complement your copy, building your users’ confidence even more.

## Blog posts

Your blog is a fantastic space for communicating updates to your Zapier integration.

For the most engaging posts, apply these best practices:

- **Explore new features**  — Announce new Zapier features in your posts and give users ideas about how they can apply those features to their work.
- **Spotlight benefits** — Inspire users by directly referencing which apps they can connect to through Zapier and how those connections support their work.

## Video tutorials

A well-made video can help break down complex ideas into easily digestible concepts—perfect for explaining Zapier to new users.

Here are two great starter videos you can create:

- **Welcome to Zapier** — Create an introductory video that walks users through a high-level overview of Zapier to help get them started.
- **Setup deep dive** — Break down the technical setup process in a thorough, engaging tutorial.
