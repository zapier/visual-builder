## Accelerate your access to these benefits by embedding

Unlock the benefits of the Zapier Partner Program faster by embedding your integration into your product via your help docs, integration pages, or blog posts. If you’re in Beta, you’ll exit Beta the next day once we detect an embed. If you’re already a Partner, you can access the benefits of the next tier faster once we detect an embed. Embedding your integration not only enhances your product's functionality but also fast-tracks your access to higher-tier benefits. It's our way of incentivizing partners to integrate with Zapier and reap the rewards sooner.

## Next steps
- Review your integration tier on the Partner Program page in the developer dashboard
- Plan benefit redemption around your integrations’ marketing calendar (and keep track of the annual usage limit of each benefit) 
- Highlight your integration in your product and marketing assets with our  [partner embedding tools](https://zapier.com/l/partner/solutions)
